    <h2>About Me</h2>
    
    <p>Welcome to my About page! Here I will explain all about my love for video games.</p>

    <p>One of my biggest passions are video games. I actually used be a very sporty kid growing up, however my parents decided to move which caused me to be further away from all of my friends. I used to be able to walk next door and ask my friends to play, but since I was too far away, I had to find another way to connect with people and pass the time. This is when I started to get more into video games. I found that multiplayer games were a great way to connect with other people, and do cool things that kids dream of like being a pirate, flying a spaceship, or being a superhero. My passion for video games continued when I built my first computer when I was 15. I was introduced to the world of PC gaming, and fell in love with competitive multiplayer games. This satisfied my competitive itch as I strived to climb through the ranks of games such as CS:GO and Call of Duty. I of course held on to my love of single player games and continued to play them along side the multiplayer games. My list of favorite games are as followed (in no particular order):</p>

    <h3>Some of My Favorite Games:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The Last of Us</li>
        <li>Counter Strike: Global Offensive</li>
        <li>Persona 3</li>
        <li>Valorant</li>
    </ul>
