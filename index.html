    <h1>Welcome to My Website!</h1>
    
    <p>Hello! My name is Patrick Yu, and this website is a place where I share my interests!</p>

    <p>I am from Mansfield, Massachusetts, and I have lived in Mass for all 23 years of my life. I might be bias, but I think Massachusetts is one of the best states in America. I am currently going to school at Northeastern University studying Computer Science and Business Administration. I am set to graduate this year, I'm both excited and nervous about what the future holds! I have 2 lovely cats named Maxine and Teddy here with me in Boston, and I live with 3 of my great friends. I love going out for walks, going to vintage markets, and playing video games. I've been a huge nerd ever since I was a kid (Star Wars Episode 3 was my favorite movie growing up). I've loved everything nerdy, and I'm glad that it has stuck with me all this time. You can find more information about my love for video games in the "about" section of this website, please check it out! </p>
